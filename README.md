# Individual-Project : Chess analysis
individual project for data science class 
Topic: Use data from Lichess's database, which provides extensive collections of games in PGN format, including move sequences, ratings, and metadata to do quantitative analysis. I won't be creating a lichess bot anymore, but doing analysis to answer questions such as:   

1. Which openings are most commonly played in different rating ranges?

2. Do players in higher rating brackets tend to play longer games?

3. How often do players checkmate versus win on time at different rating levels?

4. Which pieces are involved in the most captures for each rating level?

5. Do higher-rated players make fewer mistakes in the first 10 moves?
